      "- Maximizing visual connection within the school by arranging studios as a series of platforms within a unified mass, with the main review space serving as a central axis.",
      "- Providing framed views + different levels of transparency from the exterior to exhibit student work.",
      "- Initiating a dialogue between the building and its context by integrating the existing circulation path and defining a gateway to the campus.",

      "Pier City proposes an economically and environmentally sustainable paradigm for urban development in coastal cities that are dealing with rising sea levels and storm surge.",
      "Typical coastal defensive systems (such as seawalls, dikes, etc) are significantly costly and usually begin to fail within a decade, having to be replaced with a larger, more expensive structure. Quite often, especially in smaller cities, the cost of these structures exceeds what they were built to preserve.",
      "Besides the significant amount of resources that goes into constructing and maintaining defensive structures, they also accelerate erosion and damage the fragile coastal ecosystem.",
      "Instead of relying on defensive strategies and landscape manipulation, pier city allows for the land to take on its natural transformation and uses water to activate a new form of urban development.",
      "Pier city is made up of two adaptive overlaid systems: a system of roads/ structures on elevated piers and a smaller scale of amphibious pedestrian walks and houses.",

      "In a conventional tower, the structure and space are separate elements. Whether the structure is exterior or interior, its relationship to space remains the same from bottom to top.",
      "Our project proposes a more dynamic relationship between structure and space by conceiving them as two interlocking elements that offer a radical shift in space along the vertical axis",
