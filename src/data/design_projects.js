I worked at the construction site for 6 months and collaborated directly with consultants, contractors, and owner representatives. My focus was on the first and second floors which were on the critical path of the project and contained most of the technology and equipment for the hospital.The construction was completed in 2019",
      "The New Stanford Hospital features an innovative design blending the most advanced technologies with uplifting, healing supportive aesthetics. Most of its technology is clustered on the first and seconds floors. The Garden floor-the third-mediates between technology and humanity, featuring a dining room, gardens, patient and family resources, areas for contemplation, walking paths, and meditation spaces. Private patient rooms are located in four care pavilions above the Garden floor.",
      "Additionally, I worked on a series of other projects on the Stanford medical campus, the renovation of the Cancer Hospital, feasibility studies and schematic design for two new extensions for the existing hospital, and a master plan proposal for public spaces.",

      "Typical coastal defensive systems (such as seawalls, dikes, etc) are significantly costly and usually begin to fail within a decade, having to be replaced with a larger, more expensive structure. Quite often, especially in smaller cities, the cost of these structures exceeds what they were built to preserve.",
      "Besides the significant amount of resources that goes into constructing and maintaining defensive structures, they also accelerate erosion and damage the fragile coastal ecosystem.",
      "Instead of relying on defensive strategies and landscape manipulation, pier city allows for the land to take on its natural transformation and uses water to activate a new form of urban development.",
      "Pier city is made up of two adaptive overlaid systems: a system of roads/ structures on elevated piers and a smaller scale of amphibious pedestrian walks and houses.",
